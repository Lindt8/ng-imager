# Configuration

This page will explain how **ng-imager** is configured.

It should eventually include:
- Configuration file format (YAML/TOML/JSON)
- Default parameters and overrides
- Runtime flags and environment variables

_TODO: Describe how configuration propagates through the imaging pipeline._
