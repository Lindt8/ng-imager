# Quickstart

This section will provide a hands-on introduction to using **ng-imager**.

It should eventually cover:
- Installation instructions
- A minimal working example (MWE)
- The core workflow from data to generated image
- How to run the main scripts or notebooks

_TODO: Flesh out step-by-step user workflow once the API stabilizes._
