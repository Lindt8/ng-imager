# ng-imager

Event-cone imaging (neutrons & gamma rays) with two operating modes:

- **fastmode** — aggressive cuts + coarse SBP → quick summed image for beam time.
- **list-mode** — saves per-cone sparse pixel indices + summed image → rapid post-analysis.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .[docs]   # dev install with docs extras
# or
pip install -e .         # core only
```
