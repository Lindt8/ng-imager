# Code Architecture

This document will provide an overview of **ng-imager**'s internal structure.

Planned contents:
- High-level module and package layout
- Data flow between stages (input → simulation → imaging → export)
- Key classes and their roles
- Extension and plugin design (if any)

_TODO: Include a diagram of the processing pipeline once finalized._
